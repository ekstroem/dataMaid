To do:
- Add pdf viewer to Report tab if pdf is chosen
- Making a pdf report and then setting "output" to html crashes the application. Why?
- Write help-page
- Handle e.g. when "Please wait" is clicked (tryCatch?)
- Data-loading: If the datafile is large, do not update (reload) data without a specific command to do so
- Informative error messages e.g. when data cannot be loaded
- ?DONE? Add some indication that something is going on when "Make report" is clicked
