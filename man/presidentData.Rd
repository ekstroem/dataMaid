\description{
A dataset with information about the first 45 US presidents as well as a 46th
person, who is not a US president. The dataset was constructed to show the capabilities
of \code{dataMaid} and therefore, it has been constructed to include errors and miscodings.
Each observation in the dataset corresponds to a person. The dataset uses the 
non-standard class \code{Name} which is simply an attribute that has been added to 
two variables in order to show how \code{dataMaid} handles non-supported classes.
